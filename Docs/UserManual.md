### How to use your "Grocery List Manager" App (v1.6+):
1. Welcome to your Grocery List Manager (GLM)! Upon opening the app, you should be greeted
by a blank screen; that's normal!

2. Take notice of the "+" symbol in the top right hand corner - by tapping this, you can
create and add a new list to your GLM and start filling up some of that blank space.

3. Once you've created a list (or 10), you can do one of two things - tap a list to select it,
or press and hold a list.

4. Pressing and holding a list will open up an options menu to let you:

 * "Rename" your list
 * "Delete" your list

5. Don't like the name of your list? Then simply tap the "Rename" button after holding on the list whose name you'd like to change; once tapped, a keyboard will show for you to change your list's name as you see fit.

6. Already done shopping and don't need that old list anymore? Simply tap the "Delete" button after holding the list, and poof! It'll be gone without a trace.

7. Tapping a list will let you enter that list's Item menu.

8. The Item menu shows another "+" to let you add items to your list -
 for a newly created list, it should be empty and quite blank, so add lots of items!

9. After pressing the "+" symbol, write the name of the item you want to add to your list. The app will search its database for you so it can add that item to your list - if it's not an item that can be recognized, you can add it to our database for future reference!

10. If the search can't find your item, it will ask you to classify the item you want's type; for example, if you wanted some potatoes for Thanksgiving, and the app couldn't find them - just write their type ("vegetable in this case") and next time you need a potato, it'll automatically add and group it to your list of items with the other vegetables!

11. Once you've added an item to your list, a checkbox appears to the left of the item, while
 a number appears on the right side - this lets you adjust the quantity of that item you'd like.

12. If you're out shopping and you've gotten the item you want, you can tap a checkbox to mark it.

13. If you think you don't need an item after making the list, that's fine too! Just press and
 hold the item's name and select the "Delete Item" option.

14. Have you just finished checking the last of your items, but need to keep this list for another week? Then simply tap the "check marked" button right next to the "+" button, and it'll ask if you want to uncheck all of the checkboxes. Hit yes and all of your check boxes will be empty, and ready for the next time you need that list!

15. If you want to check a different list, simply tap your mobile device's corresponding "back"
 key and you'll be back at the main menu screen where you can begin again from the top; add a new list, or click on a different existing one!
